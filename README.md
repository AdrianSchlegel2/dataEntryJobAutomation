 This Program automatically scrapes flats + info from Zillow and puts the info together in a spreadsheet. You can predetermine the filters, in the Zillow link, as mentioned in the code. If you want to use this code yourself, you have to create a google form with these three questions on there:
 - Whats the address of the property?
 - Whats the price per month?
 - Whats the link to the property?


**In settings enter that they are short answer questions**.
Then enter your link in the code and you are ready to go.
Then to finish everything of, when the code has run, enter the gmail account you created the form with, navigate to answers and click: *create spreadsheet*.
